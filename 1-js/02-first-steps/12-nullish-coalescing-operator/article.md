# Nullish coalescing operator '??'

[recent browser="new"]

The nullish coalescing operator `??` provides a short syntax for selecting a first "defined" variable from the list.

The result of `a ?? b` is:
- `a` if it's not `null` or `undefined`,
- `b`, otherwise.

So, `x = a ?? b` is a short equivalent to:

```js
x = (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;
```

Here's a longer example.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Let's say, we have a `firstName`, `lastName` or `nickName`, all of them optional.

Let's choose the defined one and show it (or "Anonymous" if nothing is set):
=======
Imagine, we have a user, and there are variables `firstName`, `lastName` or `nickName` for their first name, last name and the nick name. All of them may be undefined, if the user decided not to enter any value.

We'd like to display the user name: one of these three variables, or show "Anonymous" if nothing is set.

Let's use the `??` operator to select the first defined one:

```js run
let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = "Supercoder";

<<<<<<< HEAD
// show the first not-null/undefined variable
alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); // Supercoder
=======
// show the first not-null/undefined value
*!*
alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); // Supercoder
*/!*
>>>>>>> fbf443e414097e5a3a41dd1273ef9a4a3230e72c
```

## Comparison with ||

<<<<<<< HEAD
That's very similar to OR `||` operator. Actually, we can replace `??` with `||` in the code above and get the same result.
=======
The OR `||` operator can be used in the same way as `??`. Actually, we can replace `??` with `||` in the code above and get the same result, as it was described in the [previous chapter](info:logical-operators#or-finds-the-first-truthy-value).
>>>>>>> fbf443e414097e5a3a41dd1273ef9a4a3230e72c

The important difference is that:
- `||` returns the first *truthy* value.
- `??` returns the first *defined* value.

This matters a lot when we'd like to treat `null/undefined` differently from `0`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
For example:
=======
For example, consider this:
>>>>>>> fbf443e414097e5a3a41dd1273ef9a4a3230e72c

```js
height = height ?? 100;
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
This sets `height` to `100` if it's not defined. But if `height` is `0`, then it remains "as is".
=======
This sets `height` to `100` if it's not defined.
>>>>>>> fbf443e414097e5a3a41dd1273ef9a4a3230e72c

Let's compare it with `||`:

```js run
let height = 0;

alert(height || 100); // 100
alert(height ?? 100); // 0
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Here, `height || 100` treats zero height as unset, same as `null`, `undefined` or any other falsy value, depeding on use cases that may be incorrect.

The `height ?? 100` returns `100` only if `height` is exactly `null` or `undefined`.

## Precedence

The precedence of the `??` operator is rather low: `7` in the [MDN table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table).

That's lower than most operators and a bit higher than `=` and `?`.

So if we need to use `??` in a complex expression, then consider adding parentheses:
=======
Here, `height || 100` treats zero height as unset, same as `null`, `undefined` or any other falsy value. So the result is `100`.

The `height ?? 100` returns `100` only if `height` is exactly `null` or `undefined`. So the `alert` shows the height value `0` "as is".

Which behavior is better depends on a particular use case. When zero height is a valid value, then `??` is preferrable.

## Precedence

The precedence of the `??` operator is rather low: `5` in the [MDN table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table).

So `??` is evaluated after most other operations, but before `=` and `?`.

If we need to choose a value with `??` in a complex expression, then consider adding parentheses:
>>>>>>> fbf443e414097e5a3a41dd1273ef9a4a3230e72c

```js run
let height = null;
let width = null;

// important: use parentheses
let area = (height ?? 100) * (width ?? 50);

alert(area); // 5000
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Otherwise, if we omit parentheses, then `*` has the higher precedence and would run first. That would be the same as:

```js
// not correct
let area = height ?? (100 * width) ?? 50;
```

There's also a related language-level limitation. Due to safety reasons, it's forbidden to use `??` together with `&&` and `||` operators.

Otherwise, if we omit parentheses, `*` has the higher precedence than `??` and would run first.

That would work be the same as:

```js
// probably not correct
let area = height ?? (100 * width) ?? 50;
```

There's also a related language-level limitation.

The code below triggers a syntax error:

```js run
let x = 1 && 2 ?? 3; // Syntax error
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
The limitation is surely debatable, but for some reason it was added to the language specification.

Use explicit parentheses to fix it:

```js run
let x = (1 && 2) ?? 3; // Works
=======
The limitation is surely debatable, but it was added to the language specification with the purpose to avoid programming mistakes, as people start to switch to `??` from `||`.

Use explicit parentheses to work around it:

```js run
*!*
let x = (1 && 2) ?? 3; // Works
*/!*

>>>>>>> fbf443e414097e5a3a41dd1273ef9a4a3230e72c
alert(x); // 2
```

## Summary

- The nullish coalescing operator `??` provides a short way to choose a "defined" value from the list.

    It's used to assign default values to variables:

    ```js
    // set height=100, if height is null or undefined
    height = height ?? 100;
    ```

- The operator `??` has a very low precedence, a bit higher than `?` and `=`.
- It's forbidden to use it with `||` or `&&` without explicit parentheses.
